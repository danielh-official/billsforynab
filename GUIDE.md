# How to Use Bills (For YNAB)

## Getting Started

Welcome to Bills (For YNAB)!

This app helps you track and visualize your recurring bills from YNAB.

## Fetching Your Bills

1. Click the "Fetch Data" button to retrieve your data from YNAB
2. The app will automatically calculate monthly equivalents for all frequencies (weekly, yearly, etc.)
3. Your data is stored locally in your browser for offline access

## Sorting Your Bills

Use the sorting options to organize your bills:

- **Next Due Date:** See which bills are coming up soon
- **Monthly Amount:** Sort by the monthly equivalent amount

Toggle between ascending and descending order using the "Sort Direction" dropdown.

## Excluding Bills

Click the checkmark (✓) or eye (👁️) icon on any bill to exclude or include it in your totals. Excluded bills appear grayed out and won't count toward your monthly/yearly totals.

## Understanding the Stats

- **Total Bills Per Month:** The sum of all bills converted to a monthly amount
- **Total Bills Per Year:** Your monthly total multiplied by 12

## Resetting Your Data

If you need to start fresh, click "Reset Data" to clear all locally stored scheduled transactions for this budget. You can then re-fetch from YNAB.

## Demo Mode
